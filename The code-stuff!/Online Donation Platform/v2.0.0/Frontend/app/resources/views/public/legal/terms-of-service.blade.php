			<h6>Summary</h6>

			<ul>

			<h6>Terms of Service</h6>

			<p>These terms of service (collectively, the <em>'Terms'</em>) govern your use of the Website and its associated services. Please read these Terms carefully. Your use of the Website and/or and its associated services constitutes your assent to these Terms.</p>

			<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. It is your responsibility to review these Terms wherever you access the Website. The latest version of these Terms will govern any future usage by you of the Website and its associated services. The date on which these Terms were last updated is stated at the top of this document.</p>




			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>




			<h6>About the causes featured on the Website</h6>

			<p>The Website and its associated services allow you to donate to and raise funds for any cause listed on the Website. Every cause featured has an agreement with DashDonate.org authorising us to collect donations on its behalf. Causes are listed on this Website at DashDonate.org's discretion; however, we are not responsible for the activities of any cause. A charity must have the appropriate authorisation, permit or licence to operate as a charity, as required by the local laws of the territory in which it operates.</p>




			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>




			<h6>Donations</h6>

			<p>Subject to the requirements of applicable local laws, once your donation is made it will only be refunded to you with the prior written consent of the cause to whom it has been directed. In the event all funds have been paid out and there are no funds available for refund, DashDonate.org reserves the right to invoice or direct debit the cause for the amount of the refund and the cause must agree to settle that invoice within one (1) month of the date of the invoice.</p>

			<p>NOTE: Occasionally, the person who created the page to which you have donated does not pass identity verification or other necessary checks, or there is some other reason that we cannot transfer the funds to them. If we are unable to transfer the funds to the cause to which you donated, we will return your donation via the payment method from which you made the donation. If we are unable to return your donation via the payment method you used, your donation will be sent to another cause, subject to the deduction of applicable transaction and payment processing fees.</p>




			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>




			<h6>Use of your donation</h6>

			<p>DashDonate.org does not represent or warrant that your donations will be used for any particular purpose and shall not be responsible for any dissatisfaction you may have regarding a cause's use of any donation you may make through the Website or its associated services or websites powered by us or for any misuse or non-use of such donations by a cause. After donations are made, all further dealings are solely between you and the cause to which you donated.</p>

			<p>Please note that recipient organisations reserve the right to use your donation for their general purposes in accordance with their practices and rules. DashDonate.org shall not be responsible for ensuring that funds are earmarked for a particular appeal. If you want a donation to be used for a specific purpose or for a particular appeal, contact the organisation and make your donation directly to them.</p>

			<p>DashDonate.org (or any payments processor or card brand we work with) will verify the authenticity of a cause, and identity of a registered charity trustee, and undertake any other necessary checks before any funds raised are transferred to the cause. DashDonate.org shall have no liability to donors whatsoever for any use or misuse of donations made to the cause. The cause may state that they will use donations only for specific purposes, but DashDonate.org cannot guarantee that they will use them for such purpose. If you have any doubts as to how the money will be spent you should contact the cause directly to seek reassurance. It is your sole responsibility, as a user of the Website, to ensure that the cause stated to be supported is one that you wish to support.</p>
