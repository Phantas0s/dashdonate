			<p>DashDonate.org is committed to respecting your privacy when we use your personal data. We use your data as described below to allow you to use DashDonate.org, enhance your experience using our platform, and comply with applicable data protection laws.</p>




			<br/>
			<br/>




			<h6>Who are we?</h6>

			<p>DashDonate.org is a trading name of Castle Holdings Group Ltd (registration no. 12088261), an entity established under the laws of England and Wales.</p>

			<p>You can contact DashDonate.org via <a href='mailto:team@dashdonate.org' target='_blank'>team@dashdonate.org</a>. This Policy applies to our collection and use of your data in connection with our services.</p><br/>




			<br/>

			<h6>How to reach our Data Protection Officer</h6>

			<p>To contact DashDonate.org’s Data Protection Officer regarding our processing of your personal data, email <a href='mailto:team@dashdonate.org' target='_blank'>team@dashdonate.org</a>.</p>




			<br/>
			<br/>

			<h6>How we notify you of changes to this policy?</h6>

			<p>We keep this Policy under regular review and place updates on DashDonate.org. We will also provide notifications of material changes via email or other channels. If you keep using the Services after we notify you, you consent to the updated Privacy Policy. If not, you may cancel your account.</p>




			<br/>
			<br/>

			<h6>What are your rights?</h6>

			<p>DashDonate.org recognises that your personal data belongs to you and we don’t wish to use it in ways that you don’t want us to.</p>

			<p>You can control whether or not you receive marketing email from DashDonate.org by visiting the account settings page in your account.</p>

			<p>If granted by applicable laws, you can also exercise a variety of rights regarding our use of your data:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>You can ask us for a copy of the information we have about you.</li>

				<li>You can ask us to correct any incorrect data we have about you and you can also update your account details yourself at any time by visiting your DashDonate.org account.</li>

				<li>You can ask us to delete your data.</li>

				<li>You can ask for your data in a common, machine-readable format.</li>

				<li>You can object to any processing we do on the basis of legitimate interests or to any automated decision-making.</li>

				<li>You can ask us to restrict the processing of your data.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Note that some of these rights may not be enforceable in your jurisdiction and some aren’t absolute—for example, we may not be able to forget you if we have to keep some of your data to comply with the law — but we’ll evaluate your request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. DashDonate.org will respond to your request within one month of receiving it. Also, note that if you’re located in the UK or the EU, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office or the supervisory authority in your country of residence or place of work.</p>

			<h6>What data do we collect?</h6>

			<p>We don’t receive any personal data about you other than what you provide us, either by creating an account, using the Services, from Facebook when you agree to connect your Facebook account to DashDonate.org, or data we can infer from your use of the Services.</p>

			<p><strong>When you create a DashDonate.org account:</strong> We will collect basic contact information about you to set up your account you so you can make donations or raise funds. This will include your name, address and email address. We will also ask you to register a password so you can gain secure access to your account in the future.</p>

			<p>Alternatively, you may authorise us to collect your basic personal details from a secure online source (e.g. Google, Facebook or a sponsor charity) to which you have already provided this information.</p>

			<p>We enable you to set an image for your DashDonate.org profile and this image is shown as a thumbnail next to all of your actions on the platform, unless you have chosen to hide your name and photo from the public when you donate. Please note that this image is dynamic and not frozen in time — e.g. if you change your image in 2018, the new image will appear next to your activities from 2015.</p>

			<p><strong>When you sign in to DashDonate.org using your Facebook account:</strong> If you choose to login via Facebook, we will obtain access to your Facebook public profile information and email address. We will use this information to allow you to login and populate our records about you. If you give us permission (via Facebook’s preference settings), we may also obtain access to your friend list but we only receive the names of your friends who are also DashDonate.org users. We will only use this to see if people on your friends list are also using our website and as set out in How we use personal information below. You can control whether or not Facebook shares this data with us, either by changing your preferences when you first login to DashDonate.org with your Facebook account or by visiting the app setting controls on Facebook’s platform.</p>

			<p><strong>When you make a donation:</strong> To enable us to process donations, we will collect basic payment information as well as your name, home address and email address. This information will not shared publicly.</p>

			<p><strong>When you give us information about others:</strong> You may decide to provide us with information about others (or authorise us to collect this information on your behalf from your social networks or your email contacts list) for example:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>So we can help you tell your friends and family about a Crowdfunding Page you are running or charity fundraising you are carrying out; or</li>

				<li>If you start fundraising or crowdfunding for, or in the memory or in celebration of, another person.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>You must ensure that they have agreed to you providing us with their information. Where required by local laws, we would advise you to keep a record of their agreement and provide them with a copy of, or link to, this Policy. This is especially the case if you provide us with sensitive information about them (e.g. a reference to an illness or health condition).</p>

			<p>You should also only contact individuals using the Services who you know would be happy to hear from you and must not use our Services to send unsolicited 'spam' messages.</p>

			<p><strong>When you use the Services:</strong> We also collect information about your use of our Services, including your IP address, mobile device identifier, how much time you spend on the site, and what you do, like or view. We do this through the use of cookies. To read more about our use of cookies, please refer to our separate <a href='{{ route('public-legal-cookies') }}' target='_blank'>Cookies Policy</a>.
